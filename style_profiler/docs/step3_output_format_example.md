STEP 3 — Output Format + Realistic Example

Return your result in this markdown format:

## emotional_tone:
- Grounded tone overall with flashes of grief and hesitation
- Emotional intensity spikes when recounting moments of loss or transition
- Delivery softens noticeably when discussing childhood or early mentors
- Increasing clarity and empowerment as story progresses
- Uses silence and long pauses to emphasize vulnerable moments

---

🧪 Example Input (from transcript):

> Speaker 1: I guess I never said this out loud before…  
> Speaker 1: There were years when I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror.  
> Speaker 1: But then — and I remember this day clearly — I finally said "enough."

---

✅ In this case, you would extract:
- Vulnerability
- Shame into courage
- Empowerment arc
- Hesitation at the start, clarity at the end

⚠️ Do not extract values, themes, or stylistic traits. Stay focused purely on emotional delivery and affect. This is not a summary — it's an emotional reading.
